Tests

- Adding to empty table
- Adding to non-empty table
- Search for key in empty table
- Search for key in non-empty table that doesn't contain key
- Search for key in non-empty table that does contain key
- Remove from empty table
- Remove from non-empty table
- Handle collisions correctly

Design V0.1
  
  Req's
    
    1) Store a fixed size array of objects
      - Size is determined by user in construction
      - Objects must have some key, be it string or some number
    
    2) Have some add method to add an object to a unique position
      - To find unique position run key through a hashing function
      - If there is a collision, handle it according to the chosen collision
        handling method

    3) Have some set of hashing functions
      - The one that will be used for the table will be chosen by the user at
        construction

    4) Have consistent way of handling collisions
      - Again chosen by user
    
    5) Return an object based on its key in as close to constant time as
       possible

    6) Keep track of number of collisions and number of objects stored
      - For analysis of performance
