Requirements from Joseph
  -Testing First
  -Implement a graph class with at least
    -A method to add a new node to the graph addNode(nodeName)
    -A method to add a new path between two nodes of the graph addPath(src, dest)
    -A method to find the shortest path shortestPath(src, dest)
    -A method to find minimum spanning tree minSpanTree()
  -Complexity analysis

Ideas
  Remember if the shortest paths have been found, store them. If a new path or node has
    been added, recreate the shortest paths.
